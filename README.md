# KeyboardSimulator
This is a desktop application that will simulate sounds based on keyboard key presses.

# Motivation
The idea behind this app is to create an instrument that is quick to pick up for people who are skilled at typing. It will generate sounds from scratch (that is, without the use of sound samples. Note that we are using the Jack C++ library). Different keystrokes will be used to create different sounds in a manner that will feel fimilair for anyone used to typeing with a QWERTY keyboard (for example, the home row will be used for frequent operations, such as changing pitch or striking a new note. Other keys will be used for effects). Currently, the keybindings have yet to be determined.
